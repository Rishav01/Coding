Given a palindromic number N in the form of string. The task is to find the smallest palindromic number greater than N using the same set of digits as in N.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = "35453"
Output: 
53435
Explanation: Next higher palindromic 
number is 53435.
Example 2:

Input: N = "33"
Output: -1
Explanation: Next higher palindromic number 
does not exist.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nextPalin() which takes the string N as input parameters and returns the answer, else if no such number exists returns "-1".

Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|log|N|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |N| ≤ 105

Steps that i thought:
1. Find the first half.
2. Find the next higher number than index zero number
3. Swap the index 0 with index of immidiate next higher number
4. Sort the number from index 1 to last number in the half number
5. return the number as (index 0 number + sorted number + sorted number in reverse + index 0 number)
Also,
1. find the scenario where need to return -1
  a. if length is 1 or lesser.
  b. if next higherNumber is equal to index 0.
